<answer>
To submit a job on the Cori supercomputer, you need to create a job script and then use the `sbatch` command to submit it to the scheduler. Here is a basic example of a job script:

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=example_job
#SBATCH --output=example_job.out
#SBATCH --error=example_job.err
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=regular

srun ./my_application
```

Save this script to a file, for example `job_script.sh`, and submit it with the following command:

```
sbatch job_script.sh
```
