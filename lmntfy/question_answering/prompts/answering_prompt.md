### Example Answer Format

To optimize your code for CPU usage at NERSC, it's crucial to focus on vectorization and parallelization. Vectorization allows your code to process multiple data points with a single instruction, effectively reducing the time your code takes to run through large datasets. Parallelization, on the other hand, involves dividing your code into multiple tasks that can be processed simultaneously, maximizing the use of available CPU resources. Combining these two strategies can lead to significant improvements in your code's performance on NERSC systems.
