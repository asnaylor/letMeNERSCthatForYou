# Let Me NERSC that For You

This is a custom-made documentation Chatbot based on the [NERSC documentation](https://docs.nersc.gov/).

## Goals

This bot is not made to replace the documentation but rather to improve information discoverability.
Our goals are to:

* Being able to answer questions on NERSC with up-to-date, *sourced*, answers,
* run fully *open source* technologies *on-premise* giving us control, security, and privacy,
* serve this model to NERSC users in production with acceptable performance,
* make it fairly easy to switch the underlying models, embeddings and LLM, to be able to follow a rapidly evolving technology.

## Installation

* clone the repo,
* use the `environment.yml` file to install dependencies with `conda`
* clone the [NERSC doc repository](https://gitlab.com/NERSC/nersc.gitlab.io/-/tree/main/docs) into a folder.

## Usage

#### Basic use

Those scripts are meant to be run locally, mainly by developers of the project:

* `chatbot.py` this is a basic local question answering loop
* `chatbot_dev.py` is a more feature rich version of local loop, making it easy to run test questions and switch models around.
* `update_database.py` update the vector database (for a given llm, sentence embeder, and vector database)[^when]
* `token_counter.py` measure the size of questions and answers for a given tokenizer

On NERSC supercomputers, you might want to run `module load python cudatoolkit cudnn pytorch` before using those commands.

[^when]: This script is run once everyday (on a scron job).

#### Superfacility API use

Those scripts are meant to be user with the superfacility API:

* `api_client.py` this is a deonstration client, calling the chatbot via the superfacility API,
* `api_consumer.py` this is a worker, answering questions asked to the superfacility API on a loop

## TODO

In no particular order:

* move to container
* get flash attention back to working[^error]

* refresh prompt (and move information chunks elsewhere?)
* refuse `svg` files from the doc (which file types are in the doc?)

* document the inner-workings,
* establish a canonical list of test questions / conversations,
* move this code to the NERSC github,

* try fine-tuning sentence embedder,
* add a [page rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) type of score to documentation items? (to be integrated with the vector search)
* try a home-trained model,

[^error]: Currently, running `python -c "import flash_attn"` triggers a `ImportError: libcudart.so.11.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory` error.
